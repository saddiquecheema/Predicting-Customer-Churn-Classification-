Customer Churn Prediction
This project implements a machine learning model to predict customer churn for a telecommunications company using the Telco Customer Churn dataset.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a classification model that can predict whether a customer will churn (leave the service) based on various customer attributes and usage patterns.

Dataset
The dataset used is WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv, which contains information about 7,043 customers with 21 features including:

Demographic information: gender, senior citizen status, partner, dependents
Account information: tenure, contract type, paperless billing, payment method
Service information: phone service, multiple lines, internet service, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, streaming TV, streaming movies
Charges: monthly charges, total charges
Target variable: Churn (whether the customer left or not)
Project Structure
The notebook follows this workflow:

Import Libraries: Essential Python libraries for data processing and machine learning
Data Loading and Exploration: Load the dataset and examine its structure
Data Preprocessing:
Handle missing values in TotalCharges column
Separate features and target variable
Identify numerical and categorical features
Feature Engineering:
Standard scaling for numerical features
One-hot encoding for categorical features
Model Building:
Create a pipeline with preprocessing and Logistic Regression
Split data into training and testing sets
Model Evaluation:
Calculate accuracy score
Generate confusion matrix
Visualize results
Key Results
The Logistic Regression model achieved:

Accuracy: 78.75%
Confusion Matrix:
True Negatives: 915
False Positives: 118
False Negatives: 181
True Positives: 193
